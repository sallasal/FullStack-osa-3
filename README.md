# Full Stack Open, part 3

This repo contains exercises for [week 3](https://fullstackopen.com/osa3/node_js_ja_express) on course Full Stack Open (University of Helsinki).

My main repo for other weeks is [here](https://github.com/sallasal/FullStackOpen).

**This is old repo just for having all commits save. I needed to create new one (to reorganize for Heroku) and current situation is [here](https://github.com/sallasal/FullStackOpen-3).**
